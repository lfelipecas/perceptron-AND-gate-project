# Perceptron AND Gate Exercise

## Description
This project demonstrates how to train a simple perceptron to replicate the logic of an AND gate using Python 3.9.19, numpy and matplotlib. The notebook walks through data preparation, model definition, training, and visualization.

## Project Structure
- `.gitignore`: This file prevents temporary files, Python cache files, environment folders (venv), and other system-generated files from being included in your Git repository.
- `Basic_Perceptron_AND_Exercise.ipynb`: The main notebook that contains all code for defining, training, and visualizing the perceptron.
- `LICENSE`: Provides the legal terms under which your code can be used, modified, and distributed.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project, its purpose, and how to use it.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies to install for running the notebook.
