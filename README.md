# Perceptron AND Gate Project

## Description
This project demonstrates how to train a simple perceptron to replicate the logic of an AND gate using Python and scikit-learn. The notebook walks through data preparation, model definition, training, and visualization.

## Project Structure
- `Perceptron_AND_Project.ipynb`: The main notebook that contains all code for defining, training, and visualizing the perceptron.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies to install for running the notebook.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project, its purpose, and how to use it.

## Requirements
This project requires basic knowledge of:
- Machine Learning (Perceptron basics)
- Python programming
- Jupyter Notebook
